<div class="content">
  <app-highlight-card title="Required Inputs"></app-highlight-card>
  <br/>
  <p>
    Thanks to Angular 16, we can now mark component and directive inputs as required. If a template includes a component
    without specifying all of its required inputs, Angular reports an error at build time.
